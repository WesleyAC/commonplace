# Commonplace

Commonplace is a notetaking program. It is a work in progress, I don't recommend that anyone attempt use it right now.

## TODO

* Add ability to delete tags
* Canonicalize tags (if tagged with `misc>foo` and `misc`, only show most specific tag)
* Switch to using sqlite for blob storage
* Add markdown export (+import?)
