# Commonplace

Commonplace is a notetaking program. It is a work in progress, I don't recommend that anyone attempt use it right now.

If you're a member of the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=288aaf8d6ddfba372520ec10690a1e1b) community, you can follow along with development on Zulip in the [#knowledge systems > wesleyac notes system](https://recurse.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/260383-knowledge-systems/topic/wesleyac.20notes.20system) topic, or if you're a member of my personal Zulip community, you can follow along in the [#projects > commonplace](https://wesleyac.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/282766-projects/topic/commonplace) topic.
