-- Note that you can have multiple notes with the same name and the same hash.

-- seems useful to allow this. This, of course, necessitates a separate ID to
-- keep track of each note object.

-- The current assumption is that notes will not usually be deleted, they will
-- instead be tagged with an "archive" tag. If a note is deleted, its history
-- will be deleted along with it, and it will be as if it never existed.
